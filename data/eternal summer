When I think of you
It's always on my mind
Is that story true?
No one saves the day
(Hey, yeah, oh)
Don't you want the truth?
Ignore reality
See, I love that feelin' too
Nobody's gonna stop right now
(Hey, yeah, oh)
Summer is coming
Won't go away
Summer is coming
It's here to stay
(Hey, yeah, oh)
I can't believe it
This is the eleventh hour
Psychedelic
Life is such a funny journey
Hercules
Your service is no longer needed
It's just like make believe
(Hey, yeah, oh)
